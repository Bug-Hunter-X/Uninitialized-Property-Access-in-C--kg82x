# Uninitialized Property Access in C#

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in C# involving the access of properties before they've been explicitly initialized.  Accessing uninitialized properties can lead to unexpected results or runtime exceptions, making it crucial to handle such scenarios appropriately.

## The Problem

In C#, if you attempt to access a property of a class before it has been given a value, the behavior isn't always clearly defined.  The property might have a default value (e.g., 0 for integers, null for objects), or it might trigger an exception depending on various factors.

## The Solution

The recommended approach is to always initialize properties either in the class constructor or at the point of declaration. This ensures predictable and consistent behavior and avoids potential runtime errors.
